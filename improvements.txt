One improvement which might considerably facilitate the coherence of the system would be extending the parsing rules - In the expected implementation of the coursework, a sentence which attributes a particular feature to a subject is automatically correlated with the other sentences that contain the respectively subject, even if it might not be the case of a relevant association. For example, in the scenario where I parsed the sentences: "John is professional" and "John is a doctor", and asked "Who is a professional doctor?", the program assumes and responds that  "John is a professional doctor", implication which might not be correct in all the contexts. 

A further improvement would be including a list with the irregular verbs, alongside their past tense forms. The implementation would be similar with the one used for functions such as verb_stem and noun_stem, which have been included in this coursework.

It would be useful to have additional grammar rules for interpreting the negation form of a sentence. Furthermore, we shall want to incorporate the short forms of the verbs in the vocabulary, such as "isn't", "doesn't", "hasn't". Otherwise, the program will assume that a sentence contains a negation only if words such as "not" are being found.
